My name is Jan Jaap de Jong. Missing: My personal "mission statement"

This early in my Data Science career, it is impossible to exaclty point out what kind of Data Scientist I will become. But if I have to choose now, I would say:

**Type A Data Scientist**
 The A is for Analysis. This type is primarily concerned with making sense of data or working with it in a fairly static way. The Type A Data Scientist is very similar to a statistician (and may be one) but knows all the practical details of working with data that aren’t taught in the statistics curriculum: data cleaning, methods for dealing with very large data sets, visualization, deep knowledge of a particular domain, writing well about data, and so on.

**Detective**
 If you choose to emphasize data analysis, you can become a Detective, a master in discovering the right data and using it to draw conclusions. A detective is familiar with modeling and engineering methods, and uses them in a lightweight way. Analysis is their focus.

**Oracle**
 Another data scientist archetype is the Oracle, someone who has mastered the skills of modeling and the tools of machine learning. They will have had exposure to analysis and engineering but their focus will be on modeling—either general machine learning models or custom, domain specific models.
