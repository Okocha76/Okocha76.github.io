_Migration is the main force behind population change in Europe.  This is one of the main conclusions from my previous blog post.  So would it be possible to predict future migration?_

The base predictive model uses data from Eurostat over the period 2000-2017. Numerous variables have an influence on migration.  So I collected and merged many datasets that might be useful. Cleaning the data was time-consuming, because of missing values and differences between datasets. I split the dataset into a train (2001-2012), validation (2013-2015) and test (2016) dataset. 

To predict whether the migration rate in an area will rise or fall in the next year is the target. For this classification problem you would expect a majority baseline close to 50%. And indeed, this is the case, 51.4% migration rate decreases the next year.

In an attempt to beat this baseline prediction, I start out with  Logistic Regression. The model uses all the features in the dataset, One Hot Encoding categorical features. Model accuracy is 56.9%.

Next, I try a Random Forest Classifier and model accuracy drops to 55.6%. Feature importances gives some further insight.
