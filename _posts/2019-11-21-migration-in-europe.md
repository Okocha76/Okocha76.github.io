_Many in Europe associate migration only with problems or even [crises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_migrant_crisis){:target="_blank"}. But at the same time, migrants are the answer to another challenge 'The Old Continent' is facing. This blog post gives some insight into this matter._

Since the beginning of this century demographics in Europe have changed a lot. At this moment the population of Europe is little over [747 million](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/europe-population/){:target="_blank"} and that number is still rising. For now at least. According to projections, from 2025 the population of Europe will decline. This will happen at an accelerating rate. Also, the contraction will hurt some countries much harder than others. This becomes clear when we break the demographics down per country.

Population change is the sum of natural change and net migration. Natural change is the number of births minus the number of deaths. Immigration minus emigration equals net migration. Throughout Europe, despite increasing life expectancy, natural change is decreasing. In 2017 the average fertility rate in the [European Union](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Fertility_statistics){:target="_blank"} was 1.59, ranging from 1.26 in Malta to 1.90 in France. A value below 2.1, the replacement-level fertility, will cause populations to decline. Unless compensated by immigration, what happened in Western Europe.

In Western Europe, population sizes have increased. Positive net migration has been the main contributor. Migrants do not only come from outside of Europe. [Free movement of workers](https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=457){:target="_blank"} encouraged many to switch countries within the European Union.

In Eastern Europe, many countries face the consequences of this EU principle. Young people are leaving, as prospects in their home country are often bleak. This causes both negative net migration and decreasing natural change. This will most likely cause more social and political instability, for example in the [Balkan](https://balkaninsight.com/2019/10/14/bye-bye-balkans-a-region-in-critical-demographic-decline/){:target="_blank"}.

A look at the regions in Europe with the highest and lowest net migration emphasizes the above. Most regions in the top 25 are in Western Europe. The bottom 25 are foremost regions in Eastern Europe. These lists also stress [rural-urban migration](https://migrationdataportal.org/themen/urbanisierung-und-migration){:target="_blank"}, but that is beyond the scope of this blog post.
